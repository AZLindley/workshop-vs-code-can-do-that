## Prerequisites

**These are important. You need to have these items installed to complete this workshop**

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node(LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker Community Edition](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [VS Code Can Do That extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=burkeholland.vs-code-can-do-that)

## Running the exercises

Open the exercise in it's own instance of VS Code...

```
cd exercise-1-customizing-the-editor
code .
```

Some of the exercises contain multiple workspaces. This allows you to load multiple projects at the same time into VS Code. If this is the case, VS Code will prompt you. Select "Yes" to open the workspace file.

There will be a "start" project and a "solution" project in the workspace. Work in the "start" project and refer to the "solution" project for the finished exercise should you get stuck.
