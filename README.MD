These exercises are part of the "VS Code Can Do That" workshop from Front End Masters.

Prerequisites...

**These are important. You need to have these items installed to complete this workshop**

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node(LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker Community Edition](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [VS Code Can Do That extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=burkeholland.vs-code-can-do-that)

## Viewing the exercises

Each folder contains an `exercise.adoc` file. These are asciidoc files. To view them, open the command palette and select "AsciiDoc: Open Locked Preview to the Side". You can then close the `.ascidoc` file and just look at the preview.

## Running the exercises

Open the exercise in it's own instance of VS Code...

```
cd exercise-1-customizing-the-editor
code .
```

Some of the exercises contain multiple workspaces. If this is the case, VS Code will prompt you. Select "Yes" to open the workspace file. There will be a "start" project and a "solution" project in the workspace. Work in the "start" project and refer to the "solution" project for the finished exercise should you get stuck.
